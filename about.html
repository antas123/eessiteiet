    <h2>ABOUT ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY</h2>
    <p>Electrical Engineering Society is the oldest student society of the Institute of Engineering and Technology Lucknow, working under the Electrical Engineering Department of the institute for enhancing the technical skills of the students.
    </p>
    <p>Since its inception, EES has benchmarked its efforts in providing a platform to the students of the department for exposure into the field of electrical engineering beyond the syllabus and curriculum, by arranging workshops, expert lectures
      and industrial visits. Maintaining its legacy of knowledge transfer from one year to another, EES bridges the gap of learning between the senior and junior students and provides a positive environment for mutual development with the help of
      various interaction sessions and by operating a departmental library.
    </p>
    <p>The core objectives and works of EES are in the direction to comply with the vision and mission of the Electrical Engineering Department and to bring out the best in the students of the department by arranging for necessary aids required for
      their development.
    </p>
    <p>If we bounce back to the history of IET Lucknow at that time when no other societies or clubs were functioning, EES organized all technical and cultural events to evolve the students to the finest. And also 'Parakram' the annual technical fest
      of IET was organized by this society.
    </p>
    <p>As due to resistors there is a voltage drop in the circuit, similarly due to some reasons flotation of participating current stopped and this society became inactive in some near past year. The day dawneth came, so was the scenario with EES
      and came back into action. By the efforts of students of EE department, a batch of 2016-20 the society was finally re-established on 22 Feb 2018 in the presence of Prof. Kuldeep Sahay, the honourable HOD of the Electrical Engineering
      Department, senior faculty members respected Prof. Bharti Dwivedi and Dr Satyendra Singh, Dr Pushkar Tripathi, Dr Arunima Verma and Faculty Adviser of EES, Dr Nitin Anand Srivastava.
    </p>
    <h3>OBJECTIVES OF EES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To reintroduce IEEE (Institute of electrical and electronic engineers) paper (which is a platform for EE and EC research field)</li>
      <li>To create an online platform to connect the whole-department.</li>
      <li>To launch technical subject’s notes that will accessible to all.</li>
      <li>To maintain and run a Departmental Library.</li>
      <li>To launch E-magazine of the electrical engineering department.</li>
      <li>To build up Alumni & college relation strong.</li>
      <li>To conduct workshops to provide practical knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
